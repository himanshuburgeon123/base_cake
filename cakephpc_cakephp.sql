The result: Unhappy Customers Switching Carriers, Lost revenue for Carriers because of no fault of their own, Customer churn. Enterprises get unexpected, large bills and demands for payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fraud Types</strong><br />\r\nThere are several types of fraud, But most important ones are:<br />\r\n1- False Answer Supervision (FAS),<br />\r\n2- Premium Rate Fraud (IPRF) and<br />\r\n3- Mobile Fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left-side"><img alt="" src="img/img-9.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>FAS is perhaps the most prevalent and is under the control of international carriers. So What is FAS? FAS occurs when a call is falsely answered by a downstream carrier so they can start billing well in advance of the real answer. Even worse for customers is a phenomenon, known as call hijacking, where the call is routed to an automated voice system designed to keep them on the phone while billing continues; not only do they get a huge bill, but the call does not even reach the dialed customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IPRF occurs when a premium rate service provider colludes with a hacker to break into a PBX, launch a large number of calls to an international premium rate destination, get a share of the profits from the distant service provider, and disappear before the break-in is found. The enterprise whose PBX was hacked refuses to pay the bill and carriers in the chain dispute billing, resulting in large losses for all concerned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile Fraud is very damaging to the mobile industry with cloned SIMs and roaming fraud generating many unpaid calls to distant high rate premium codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="width:100%; float:left;"><strong>Carriers Fight Back</strong><br />\r\nCarriers are now increasingly serious about fighting fraud. They have banded together, under the aegis of the standards i3Forum, to publish a process that removes traffic for weeks from those carriers without efficient fraud management systems, resulting in considerable revenue loss.<br />\r\nIf you don&#39;t police fraud in your network, you risk losing revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="width:100%; float:left;">There are probe based solutions in the market that do not come close to our solution in delivering features and functions and aren&#39;t effective in eradicating FAS. They have their limitations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="int-content">\r\n	<li>In case of probe based solution, you need to have the carrier launch several synthetic calls to a all these destinations. If not FAS goes undetected.</li>\r\n	<li>Fraudsters are getting smart: for example, blended FAS which is done intelligently by the fraudulent suppliers in the network to avoid detection: FAS is switched on and off. for probe&#39;s synthetic calls to detect such blended FAS, the carrier needs to place several test calls to the same destination, daily, and then out of several to a destination, a couple may detect blended FAS. when you have blended FAS happening in the intl destinations, the OPex rises, the solution becomes more expensive than the issue it addresses.</li>\r\n	<li>Probe based solutions cannot handle the volume of CDRs our solution can handle</li>\r\n	<li>Probe based solution cannot accurately quantify fraud. Datanomers&rsquo; statistical solution is not academic. It quantifies fraud. It helps you make decisions to remediate supplier and goes a step further than all other solutions in the market. Our FAS solution stores the cdrs of fraud calls which provides you with the irrefutable evidence that a supplier was doing FAS.

One such solution is Call Quality Solution for enterprise and carriers. Some of the biggest enterprises in the world have benefited financially from this solution. CQM is our flagship Big Data Solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Challenge</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-bottom:24px;">Call Quality has been defined and measured very narrowly in the industry. It&rsquo;s synonymous with &ldquo;voice quality,&rdquo; usually measured by ITU-T G.107 and P.862 that map to Mean Opinion Score (MOS). A call, however, has many other facets than voice. For instance, a subscriber is on a mobile, driving along, the call may have sounded fine while driving, but it dropped, and that&rsquo;s a big nuisance. The subscriber will have to redial to resume conversation, worse still if it were an enterprise subscriber on a conference call who has to enter several digits to log back in.<br />\r\nAnother scenario: a subscriber repeatedly dials an international termination, only to find that the call goes into a black hole (either due to excessive post dial delay or poor completion rate). It&rsquo;s irritating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do any of the following scenarios sound familiar?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Do your calls go into a black hole? (retry several times, before your calls connect)</li>\r\n	<li>Do your calls have excessive post dial delay (wait for ringback, hangup, redial and wait longer for ringback)</li>\r\n	<li>Do your calls disrupt midway? (mobile calls drop, VoIP calls disconnect after a couple of seconds)</li>\r\n	<li>Do your calls have poor audio? (considerable echo, choppy or robotic audio, bursts of one-way voice)</li>\r\n	<li>Does your management solution pin-point root cause and how to fix it?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you get bills for incorrect amount? (routed to spurious announcements and billed, hacked PBX originates premium rate international calls)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you answer yes to any or all of the above scenarios, your Quality of User Experience (QUES) is not ideal and Datanomers Big Data CQM Solution will help.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Call Quality Solution ensures better Quality of User Experience. What do we mean by QUES (Quality of User Experience)? Calls are monitored proactively in real time and re-routed to a better carrier to avoid bad user experience. Such calls are assigned a very low, subpar QUES Score by our Solution and our CQM Manager not only flags these calls but also suggest how to re-route such calls for high QUES score and low customer churn which Results in high customer satisfaction. To ensure high QUE, the alerts are generated in near real-time using Advanced Statistical Algorithms and Automation, You re-route the traffic to an alternative carrier that is better and recommended by &quot;Our Intelligent Analytics Modeler (IAM)&quot;, One of its kind in the market. This proactive management differentiates a voice service offered by a carrier or enterprise. Our Call Quality Manager works off your CDRs and differentiates from its competitors in that it is the first Solution in the market that provides Comprehensive State-of-the-Art QUES Score by managing the entire calling experience for an end user (call drops, high post dial delay, poor audio, poor connection rate - comprehensive QUES score). Most Industry Solutions today just monitor audio Quality (MOS)<br />\r\nOur solution has the ability to monitor 100 to 150 million calls per 24 hours in real time and is Comprehensive and based on Advanced Statistical Machine Learning Algorithms that monitors end to end User Experience to ensure Excellent QUES Score for a converged (fixed &amp; mobile) ubiquitous anytime-anywhere communication for the carriers and enterprise</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Datanomers Call Quality kernel &ndash; Call Setup Quality(CSQ) </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Solves ECR (Excessive Call Retries)</li>\r\n	<li>Solves HPDD(High Post Dial Delay)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class="left-side"><img alt="" src="img/img-2.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Datanomers Call Quality kernel &ndash; Call Conversational Quality(CCQ)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul class="int-content">\r\n	<li>Solves ECD (Excessive Call Disruptions)</li>\r\n	<li>Solves PAQ(Poor Audio Quality)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class="left-side"><img alt="" src="img/img-3.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Must You Implement Call Quality Manager Now?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the world whether for enterprise or consumer traffic is still tied to uni-dimensional (call duration, completion rate) or MOS, which measure voice. The early birds, some of whom have moved towards comprehensive QUES, will have first movers advantage. VoIPX is on the horizon, offering superior MPLS transport to the feature-rich IMS platform. It&rsquo;s big promise is to enhance the quality of call experience for subscribers. With considerable investment in VoIPX, it makes a lot of sense for carriers and enterprises to measure and manage the performance of their VoIPX network for quality. Many customers, enterprises, OTTs, and mobile providers &ndash; are particularly concerned about subscriber&rsquo;s experience of a call. It directly impacts subscriber churn. They have, or are implementing, Call Quality Manager. Those enterprises who also do, stand to gain their business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Differentiates Datanomers Solution from Others?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Datanomers&rsquo; Call Quality Manager works off your network Call Detail Records to detect poor call quality in near real-time by statistically analyzing CDRs to identify the small variations in call patterns that represent poor calls. Multiple statistical models, each representing a use case, operate in parallel. It resides in your data center (License model), or as some customers prefer, in our Partner&rsquo;s cloud (SaaS model). This results in several advantages that are unmatched:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="full-width-img"><img alt="" src="img/img-4.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<div class="full-width-img"><img alt="" src="img/img-5.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p style="margin-top:10px;">Try our solution free for 15 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="float:left;">\r\n<h3>Our Differentiator: A Next-Gen Approach &ndash; High ROI</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Manage for better user experience.

However, keeping the promise is extremely challenging unless rigorous quality management measures are put in place. The measures must comprehensively address the 3 levels of QoS for IPX deployments &ndash; Transport, IPX Service and User Experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transport:</strong> Is the underlying MPLS network delivering the designed packet loss, latency, jitter? Are the different VPNs (e.g. by service, by customer) delivering the required transport service level?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IPX Service:</strong> Are the service layers delivering the specified edge to edge service agreed in the SLA? Is this being achieved across peered IPXs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>End to End Service:</strong> Is the end user getting the service they expect? Although this might not be SLA, what is being achieved?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>QoS must be monitored and delivered at both transport and service level. Transport paths must be monitored using the paths actually used by service components (not just the IP path) and across peered IPXs. Service monitoring must ensure service delivery across IPX from edge to edge plus acceptable service delivery end to end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Datanomers&rsquo; IPX QoS Performance Manager</strong> is a comprehensive solution suite that helps manage the quality of service for IPX deployments end to end.

The solution also includes a troubleshooter (fault management) that uses smart probes to pin-point congested IP node.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>IPX Service Performance Manager</strong> that monitors IMS service nodes periodically for each service type, alerting if SLAs associated with service are violated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div class="full-width-img"><img alt="" src="http://datanomers.checkyourprojects.com/app/webroot/ck_files/images/img-14.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Intelligent QoS Manager</strong> that provides intelligent insights in the performance behavior of IPX by correlating Transport and service alerts to sectionalize the fault and also provides rich set of reports that graphically describe SLA offenders and their offenses.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>User Experience QoS Manager</strong> provides a measure of end user experience by monitoring call records to determine true customer experience.

The result: Unhappy Customers Switching Carriers, Lost revenue for Carriers because of no fault of their own, Customer churn. Enterprises get unexpected, large bills and demands for payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fraud Types</strong><br />\r\nThere are several types of fraud, But most important ones are:<br />\r\n1- False Answer Supervision (FAS),<br />\r\n2- Premium Rate Fraud (IPRF) and<br />\r\n3- Mobile Fraud.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class="left-side"><img alt="" src="http://datanomers.checkyourprojects.com/app/webroot/ck_files/images/img-9.png" /></div>\r\n\r\n<p>FAS is perhaps the most prevalent and is under the control of international carriers. So What is FAS? FAS occurs when a call is falsely answered by a downstream carrier so they can start billing well in advance of the real answer. Even worse for customers is a phenomenon, known as call hijacking, where the call is routed to an automated voice system designed to keep them on the phone while billing continues; not only do they get a huge bill, but the call does not even reach the dialed customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IPRF occurs when a premium rate service provider colludes with a hacker to break into a PBX, launch a large number of calls to an international premium rate destination, get a share of the profits from the distant service provider, and disappear before the break-in is found. The enterprise whose PBX was hacked refuses to pay the bill and carriers in the chain dispute billing, resulting in large losses for all concerned!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile Fraud is very damaging to the mobile industry with cloned SIMs and roaming fraud generating many unpaid calls to distant high rate premium codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="width:100%; float:left;"><strong>Carriers Fight Back</strong><br />\r\nCarriers are now increasingly serious about fighting fraud. They have banded together, under the aegis of the standards i3Forum, to publish a process that removes traffic for weeks from those carriers without efficient fraud management systems, resulting in considerable revenue loss.<br />\r\nIf you don&#39;t police fraud in your network, you risk losing revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="width:100%; float:left;">There are probe based solutions in the market that do not come close to our solution in delivering features and functions and aren&#39;t effective in eradicating FAS.

If not FAS goes undetected.</li>\r\n	<li>Fraudsters are getting smart: for example, blended FAS which is done intelligently by the fraudulent suppliers in the network to avoid detection: FAS is switched on and off. for probe&#39;s synthetic calls to detect such blended FAS, the carrier needs to place several test calls to the same destination, daily, and then out of several to a destination, a couple may detect blended FAS. when you have blended FAS happening in the intl destinations, the OPex rises, the solution becomes more expensive than the issue it addresses.</li>\r\n	<li>Probe based solutions cannot handle the volume of CDRs our solution can handle</li>\r\n	<li>Probe based solution cannot accurately quantify fraud.

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
